uglyGui

Francis Deck

uglyGui is my "wrapper" for tkinter. Its purpose is to let me throw together ugly but serviceable GUI's quickly, with minimal boilerplate. All layout is automatic. Widgets are arranged vertically in the order that they're created.

I'll be using it in some of the other programs that I share, so it belongs in its own repo.

History: In the mid 80's, I wrote a graphing program in Turbo Pascal. The program quickly ballooned into screen after screen of options, as I added stuff to meet my own needs. I quickly got sick of "hard coding" menus, so I wrote a library that generated my menus automatically.

uglyGui is the same concept, in Python, using the tkinter library, plus matplotlib for graphing.

I don't have a use for huge, elaborate GUI's right now. I do most of my work these days in Jupyter notebooks. But for some kinds of hardware testing work, a bare bones GUI lets me control my programs with one hand, in awkward places such as at my workbench. My audioAnalyzer program is an example of such a use.
